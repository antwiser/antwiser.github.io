Hi there! I’m **Jiacai Yi** (蚁佳才), a PhD candidate dedicated to revolutionizing drug discovery through the power of artificial intelligence. My research focuses on **leveraging AI to accelerate drug design**, where I develop computational tools and machine learning models to streamline the identification, optimization, and development of new drug.  

But my curiosity doesn’t stop at science. I’m also deeply fascinated by **Yijing (The Book of Changes)**, an ancient Chinese philosophy that explores the dynamic balance of the universe. To me, Yijing is like a timeless algorithm—a system of patterns and principles that offers profound insights into the interconnectedness of life. Whether I’m decoding molecular structures or interpreting hexagrams, I find joy in uncovering hidden patterns and making sense of complexity. 👀

Whether you’re a fellow researcher, a curious student, or just someone fascinated by the power of AI, I’m glad you’re here. Let’s connect and explore the future of AI4Drug—and the mysteries of the universe— together!  🚀

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate, discuss ideas, or just chat about the wonders of science and philosophy. After all, the best discoveries often start with a conversation.
